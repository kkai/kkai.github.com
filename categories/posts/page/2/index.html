        <p class="lead"> Smart glasses and, in general, eyewear are a fairly novel device class with a lot of possibilities for unobtrusive activity tracking. That's why I'm very excited to be working in the Team of Masahiko Inami Sensei at Keio Media Design to do research on J!NS MEME.</p>
<p>You might have seen the <a href="http://academic.jins.com/en/"> J!NS academic videos </a> by now,
I added embedded versions to the end of the post.</p>
<p>Bellow is the full video of the sneak peek of our work in the J!NS promotion. Special thanks to <a href="http://shoya.io/aboutme/"> Shoya Ishimaru </a> and <a href="http://questbe.at">Katsuma Tanaka </a>, two talented students
Koichi Kise Sensei (Osaka Prefecture University)
and I are co-supervising. Check out their other (private) work if you are into programming for smart phones, Mac, iOS and Google Glass ;).
The video is a summary  of research work mostly done by Shoya.</p>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/113188940" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>In the video we show applications using an early prototype of J!NS MEME, smart glasses with integrated electrodes to detect eye movements (Electrooculography, EOG) and motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) to monitor head motions. We show several demonstrations: a simple eye movement visualization, detecting left/right eye motion and blink. Additionally, users can play a game, &ldquo;Blinky Bird&rdquo;. They need to help a bird avoid obstacles using eye movements. Using a combination of blink, eye movement and head motion
we can also detect reading and talking behavior. We can give people a long term view of their reading, talking, and also walking activity over the day.</p>
<p>Publications still pending, so I cannot
talk about the features, algorithms used etc.
In the mean time, here is a demo we gave at UbiComp this year.</p>

    <div class="post-entry">
        
        <p class="lead"> As the first article about
my grandparents using Google Glass received a lot of interest,
I decided to delve a little bit more into the topic.</p>
<p>My grandparents conducted a longer Google Glass usability study for me.
I&rsquo;m happy they agreed that I can use their images and
insights to share here.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/work.jpg" alt="oma">
<img src="/imgs/shopping_g.jpeg" alt="opa"></p>
<p>##Evaluation of the Current Google Glass</p>
<p>My grandparents mentioned that the current functionality of the device is quite limited. This might be due to the English only menu and bad to no Internet connectivity during usage. The experimental setup seems unobtrusive, as both of them are used to wear glasses, they got easily accustomed to carry Glass. All confirmed that the head-mounted display was not hindering them performing everyday tasks. Only
my grandmother mentioned discomfort as the device got unusual hot after a longer usage session of recording video and displaying directions.
<D-r>
During the simple reading test, they could read text of font sizes of 40px and higher on the 640 x 360 screen if a white font on a black background was used (best contrast). However, other font colors were problematic and needed larger sizes to be legible. Especially the light grey font color
sed by some standard Glass applications  was hard to read. For example, they could not read the night temperature for the weather card.
Participants were able to use most speech commands and the &ldquo;head wake&rdquo; feature (tilting the head back to activate Glass) without problems. Only the &ldquo;google search&rdquo; speech command was not recognized, probably due to German accent ;)</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/wrong_g.png" alt="oma">
<img src="/imgs/dessert_g.png" alt="opa"></p>
<p>While both were able to activate the photo functions easily, they had difficulties to take the picture they intended. Glass seems to be optimized for taking photos in a slight distance (e.g. taking tourist pictures). However, my grandparents mostly wanted to take pictures to remember what they were doing (e.g. what things they had in the hand). It took a while for them to realize that the camera won’t make a photo of what they see (depicted in the both pictures above).</p>
<p>It was difficult for the two to use the touch panel for navigating Glass. The activation tab and scrolling usually works, yet the cancel gesture (”swiping down”) is more problematic and often not recognized. We assume this is due to fingers getting dry when getting older.</p>
<p>The active card display of Glass – swiping right to see cards relevant right now (e.g. weather, appointments), swiping left to see older events (e.g. taken pictures) – was intuitive. Yet, they had difficulties to use some of the hierarchical menu structures (e.g. for settings and doing a video call). They mentioned that it is hard to realize in which context they are currently operating, as Glass gives no indication of the hierarchy level.</p>
<p>###Usage Patterns
Already during the two days of system use and the shopping tour a number of usage patterns emerged. They used the camera feature the most. A common use case was memory augmentation. Making pictures of things they don&rsquo;t want to forget. For example, taking a picture of medication, so they can remember that it was already taken or taking pictures of interesting items while shopping.</p>
<p>Both preferred the &ldquo;hands free&rdquo; operations using the speech interface (although it was in English) compared to the touch interface during house work. Yet, being in town, they switched to the touch interface.
During cooking and house work, my grandmother appreciated the timer provided by Glass. However, it was difficult for them to set the timer using the current interface, as this involves a hierarchical menu. It was not clear if they currently change the hours, minutes or seconds while in the respective sub menu. Wearing the timer on the body is highly appreciated, as it&rsquo;s not possible to miss the timer going off.</p>
<p>For gardening and cooking, they would like to do video chats, for example to ask friends about tips and get their advice. Unfortunately, the limited internet reception at participants’ place did not allow video chats during the test phase.</p>
<p>###Requirements</p>
<p>Through the initial assessment of the system&rsquo;s functionalities and through the observation we found a number of requirements.
The focus on readability is even more crucial for older adults. Although Glass was already designed with this in mind, it seems font size is not the only thing that matters. Contrast seems equally important, as participants found it very difficult to read the light grey fonts used in some of the screens provided by Glass.</p>
<p>My grandparents request intuitive, hands-free interactions. They appreciated the speech interface if they are not in public or the &ldquo;blink to take a picture&rdquo; feature as they don&rsquo;t need to interact with the touch panel. They also did not want to make the device dirty, especially during cooking and gardening.
The touch interface was sometimes difficult to use for them. A potential reason is that they are not used to capacitive touch devices such as current smartphones. Scrolling worked, yet the cancel gesture (swiping down) was difficult to perform. It needed 2 or 3 tries every time they wanted to use it.</p>
<p>##Application Ideas
<img src="/imgs/garden_g.jpeg" alt="work"></p>
<p><strong>Short Term Memory Augmentation</strong> – As we described above, participants frequently took pictures to use them as reminder (e.g. taking medication). Using the time card interface of Glass, it was already easy to check if they performed the ac- tion or task in question by browsing through the taken pic- tures. Each picture has also a timestamp with it (see Figure 2). However, this only works for the last couple of days, as other- wise the user needs to scroll too far back. The most requested feature was Zoom for images. While shopping, users took pictures to remember interesting items. Prices from items can be recorded, yet as the device does not support zoom for pic- tures, it’s impossible to read the price on the head mounted display (see Figure 5).</p>
<p><strong>Long Term Capture and Access</strong>– The participants saw po- tential in having a long term capture and access interface. Checking how and what they worked on/did a couple months or even years back. Search on specific activities (e.g. bak- ing a apple cake) should be possible for access. Participants thought other types of indexing (e.g. location or time) would be not so useful.</p>
<p><strong>Timer and Reminders</strong> – Although the interface was not op- timal for them the users already found the timer application useful. The raised the need for several simultaneous timers and reminders. Right now the installed timer application just supports a single task.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong> – For the gardening, cooking and workshop scenario, my grandparents would like to get instructions (e.g. ingredient lists, work steps) for more complex tasks they do not perform often. They prefer the Glass display to paper or instruction manuals, as they don’t need a context switch, clean their hands, stop what they do. Yet, they emphasized that the instructions need to be easily browsable. They would prefer the ”right” information at the ”right” time. Participant 2: ”Can’t Glass infer that I’m backing a cake right now and show me the ingredients I need for it?”</p>
<p>##Summary</p>
<p>These application scenarios are very similar to applications discussed for maintenance and, in general, industrial domains. Yet, as seen from the requirements usability and interface need to be adjusted significantly before wearable computing can be used by older adults without help.</p>

<p>Ok, I&rsquo;m &ldquo;a bit&rdquo; biased as I&rsquo;m one of the conference co-chairs. Still I enjoyed this years Augmented Human.
Below is the tag cloud from all abstracts, to give you a brief overview about the topics.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/ah-cloud.png" alt="Tag Cloud"></p>
<p>Considering the small size of the conference, the quality of the work is exceptional. It&rsquo;s not one of the conferences that gets the rejected papers from CHI, Ubicomp, PerComp etc. The steering committee really set up a venue for far-out, novel ideas. Also it&rsquo;s a good opportunity to meet great researchers up close; last year for example Thad Starner, Albrecht Schmidt etc. this year, Jun Rekimoto, Masahiko Inami, Paul Lukowicz and especially <a href="http://www.cyberdyne.jp/english/">Yoshiyuki Sankai</a> &hellip;
pretty impressive if you ask me. They might be around at other bigger events, yet try to catch them and talk to them, impossible. At AH, it&rsquo;s very easy. I recommend any young researcher interested in the research topics to attend next year&rsquo;s AH. Surely, I will try to get some papers accepted ;)</p>
<p>I believe we will see a lot of the work presented at AH2014 at CHI or Ubicomp next year. Yet, decide for yourself.</p>
<p>In the following, I&rsquo;ll show you just a couple of highlights. I&rsquo;m sorry, I cannot mention all of the cool work (I realized by writing that the blog post got bigger and bigger and decided to stop at some point so I can finally publish it &hellip;).</p>
<p>#Sports#
As already the tag cloud suggested, augmenting sports was a hot topic at the conference.</p>
<p>So just in case you want to play a round of Quidditch or Shaolin Soccer in the real world, we might have the tech for it. Rekimoto research about &ldquo;Hover Ball&rdquo;.
This topic has also been picked up by the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129614.900-dronepowered-hoverball-could-spice-up-games.html">New Scientist</a>.
I also recommend to check out some work by Takuya Nojima Sensei (TAMA and PhotoelasticBall).</p>
<p>The best paper award also went to a sports themed paper: &ldquo;Around Me: A System for Providing Sports Player&rsquo;s Self-images with an Escort Robot&rdquo;. Nice!</p>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/88497066" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>#Around the Eye#
As you might know, I have a personal interest in <a href="http://kaikunze.de/posts/30c3-toward-a-cognitive-quantified-self/">Eyetracking and related research</a>, as I think it&rsquo;s a very promising direction (especially inferring types of information that you otherwise cannot easily get hold off). So I was very curious about related work presented at AH about the topic and was not disappointed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if I feel comfortable sharing my sad emotions, as suggested by Tearsense (Marina Mitani, Yasuaki Kakehi). Maybe in a dark cinema this is alright. As a part of life logging it might be also interesting. We had a couple of interesting discussions also during the social about the technology.</p>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/88341946" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> 
<p>Asako Hosobori and Yasuaki Kakehi want to support face to face interaction with Eyefeel &amp; EyeChime.
Although the setup still seems a bit unnatural, I love the direction of the research using technology to enrich our social life and make us focus more on things that are important (away from looking at smartphone screens). Yet, judge yourself.</p>
<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/88344477" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>#Haptics#</p>
<p>The most far out work regarding output devices was
definitely &ldquo;A Haptic Foot Interface for Language Communication&rdquo; by Erik Hill et. al. They use vibration
motors to convey text messages on your foot. Made me wonder why we don&rsquo;t use our feet more for HCI, regarding how sensitive our feet are and that a large part of our brain is also dedicated to sensing on the foot.</p>
<p>Max Peiffer et. al. showed how to make free-hand interactions (e.g. with a kinect or similar body tracking system) more realistic using haptic feedback. Nice work!</p>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/MMe6-ZG4-ww" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The half implant device on a fingernail by Emi Tamaki and Ken Iwasaki was also nice; especially considering that it&rsquo;s already (or soon) a commercial product.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/M2IwAeVe1lg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>As always, I particularly liked Inami-Sensei&rsquo;s work.
Suzanne Low presented &ldquo;Pressure Detection on Mobile Phone By Camera and Flash&rdquo;. Very innovative use of the camera and nice demonstrations.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2MQkFmQr_TI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Also the multi-touch car steering wheel presented by Shunsuke Koyama (you can do gestures anywhere on the wheel) was really well thought out and cool research.
<p>#Our work#
We had 3 papers and 1 poster at the conference.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m particularly proud of Okoso&rsquo;s and Shoya&rsquo;s work.
They are both still Bachelor students and their
research is already published in an international conference.</p>
<p>As Shoya was still visiting DFKI in Germany, he sadly
could not attend.
Okoso gave the Tongue Interface presentation and I was impressed by her. It&rsquo;s her first talk at a conference and she&rsquo;s a 3rd year bachelor. The English was perfect, the talk easy to understand and entertaining. Well done!</p>

    <div class="post-entry">
        
        <p class="lead">  
Attending the International Symposium on Service Systems Science on the 26.02.2014 in Tokyo, I got a glimpse on how the next steps of FuturICT and how similar projects and efforts are on their way in Japan.
</p>
<p>Although the <a href="http://www.futurict.eu">FuturICT</a> project did not get funding from
the EU so far (I still believe this was a grave mistake),
I can see that the spirit and our ideas live on. The Japanese COI-T Program focuses on the same issues and problems as FuturICT.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/pres.jpg" alt="FuturICT"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.soms.ethz.ch/people/dhelbing">Dirk Helbing</a>&rsquo;s presentation gave an overview of the FuturICT effort and the refined research agenda. I really enjoyed seeing how the material has matured.
Also the talks from Shunri Oda and Maso Fukuma addressed similar problems and presented similar conclusions.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Cornelius Herstatt gave some interesting observations about the future potential of the Japanese Market. Especially, I liked his conclusions about the use of robots in society: Seeing robots not as replacements to workers but as complementary, allowing more independence and privacy for older adults.</p>
<p>#Take Home Message#
Not sure, if I got it right as social and system sciences are quite new to me, but what I took home from the
symposium:
System behavior is determined by connectivity patterns, coupling strength, interactions etc. and small changes in any of them can lead to dramatic changes in the overall system.
Technology today has fundamentally changed connectivity and coupling in human interactions. Yet, so far we develop technology as a standalone in an uncontrolled way. So far, we have little idea how it influences society.</p>
<p>The Internet made any piece of digital, archival knowledge instantly, globally available.
We are now at the verge of any real life event becoming, instantly globally connected to the digital domain.
With this &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo; we might have a perfect substrate and basis to explore these effects. A key word seems &ldquo;participatory social sensing&rdquo;.
<img src="/imgs/Tokyo.jpg" alt="FuturICT"></p>
<p>#Discussions and Plenary Summary#
The discussions centered around the big
picture of society and how to induce beneficial change (as well as to prevent negative effects).
Yet, most strikingly, the panel members also mentioned
some concrete ideas about change and addressed especially
the research community. There was a long discussion about how to accelerate research, in which Dirk Helbing again emphasized his concept of an &ldquo;Idea Github for researchers&rdquo;: a platform to share ideas /implementations and research results more freely with easy reproducibility and attribution to the corresponding inventors. The main premise is it should not take us 2-3 years to finally publish our findings.</p>
<p>I ran into this problem, also in the wearable computing field. It is hard for &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; (researchers not in the community) to enter the field. If they just read papers and work on the published research, they can never work on bleeding edge research. You have to meet with people of the different labs and know what they are working on to find interesting topics (and more important they have to trust you &hellip;).</p>
<p>#Concluding#
I&rsquo;m very happy that the FuturICT lives on.
In general, I find the Japanese research community
is very open towards social computing, especially the idea of participatory social sensing. Maybe it&rsquo;s more fruitful to continue the project ideas first here in Japan. It&rsquo;s a bit sad that Europe has given away the chance of being a innovation leader in this field.
Yet meeting Dirk again and seeing how his ideas and research towards social computing matured and developed was also great. Europe might have missed a chance, yet there&rsquo;s still hope ;)</p>
<p>If you got interested in research about society and social science, I can recommed <a href="http://www.springer.com/physics/complexity/book/978-3-642-28999-6">&ldquo;Society is a Complex Matter&rdquo; by Philip Ball</a>. It&rsquo;s an engaging read for novices to the topic. I could get a copy of at the event.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry it took so long to put online.
Too much to do, especially due to Augmented Human 2014 (really looking forward to the beginning of march) :)</p>
<p>As part of our monthly <a href="http://hnkansai.org">Hacker News meetup</a>in Kansai,
I gave a small introduction on how to use (and hack for) Google Glass.</p>
<script class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="a241cc30769d0131bdae2a0fad9cf655" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"> </script>
<p>The slides are also available as <a href="../../slides/kansai_15.pdf">pdf download</a> (7 MB).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Hacks&rdquo; are fairly simple. I more or less show how to develop for Glass using the Native Development Kit and some demonstrations how to read out sensors or other demo code I scraped from github and adjusted (see the slides for links to the sources). The examples include CameraZoom, Face Detection and Blink Recognition.</p>

        <p class="lead">Impressions and Talk Recommendations. Finally, a couple of days with normal people ...</p>
<p>Honestly I was impressed by the professionalism of the 30th Chaos Communication Congress. It changed a lot from the last time I visited ( 25c3), grew bigger without loosing its atmosphere. With the assemblies and workshops the event starts to get more and more interactive.</p>
<p>##Talk Recommendations##</p>
<p>I link to the youtube streams of the recordings
yet you can get them also over at <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/">media.ccc.de</a></p>
<p>Due to recent events, there were a lot of Snowden/NSA themed talks. I skipped most of them (as some were just plain to catch attention, others were simply to depressing).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTVgPw7TR_k">Seeing The Secret State: Six Landscapes</a> is a must watch on the topic. I don&rsquo;t want to spoil to much, just watch it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52NbMghN4ws">Machines that make</a> DIY is always fun. Although talking with Nadya Peek after the presentation, I think she could have given a better talk (the chat was more interesting).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o2xBOQeB7Q">How to Build a Mind</a> Relatively high level talk about artificial
intelligence and related topics, quite entertaining.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er9luiBa32k">FPGA 101</a>
Karsten Becker gives a good overview about why and when you want/don&rsquo;t want to use FPGAs. I have not much experience, yet usually programming FPGAs sucked the few days I tried it.
The toolchain he introduces sounds cool.
As a friend of mine said the right level
of nerdiness enough to be interesting and
not too much to lose the audience.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPEzLNh5YIo">SD-Card Exploits</a>
So SD-cards have micro processors and guess what you can program them yourself. Quite scary :)</p>
<p>##My Talk Feedback##
I was a bit surprised how positive it was.
As the talk is kind of scary. If you imagine
we are really able to infer how much somebody
understands about a material using eye gaze,
who should be allowed to access this information?
Is it alright, to trust Google, Apple, Samsung etc.
with this type of information? It might no longer be
&ldquo;just&rdquo; our personal communication that can be
recorded and analyzed, but also our reading habits and
comprehension level.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, feel free <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LrARH4KJRro">to watch it</a>.
You can also <a href="https://frab.cccv.de/en/30C3/public/events/5387/feedback/new">give feedback</a> on the talk if you want.
Highly appreciated.</p>

<p>##Talk Abstract##</p>
<p>The talk gives an overview about our work of quantifying knowledge acquisition tasks in real-life environments, focusing on reading. We combine several pervasive sensing approaches (computer vision, motion-based activity recognition etc.) to tackle the problem of recognizing and classifying knowledge acquisition tasks with a special focus on reading.</p>

So I got my hands on another Glass device and can now
play with it a bit longer.
</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Rooting and flashing your device voids your warranty and can brick your Glass. Also you won&rsquo;t receive OTA updates afterwards.
This is not an instruction manual. I just use it as
a scratch pad to give a record what I did and
what worked for me. The commands below will erase all data on your device. Proceed at your own risk.</p>
<p>##Rooting and Flashing Images##
To get root follow the instructions from Google.
Unfortunately, the fastboot under Mac OS does not work.
I could use a virtual machine on my Mac with ubuntu
to get root and flash images.</p>
<pre><code>adb devices
adb reboot-bootloader
fastboot devices

fastboot oem unlock
</code></pre>
<p>I needed to execute the last command twice. The first time
it just asked me if I was sure if I want to void my
warranty etc.</p>
<p>Next I flashed the boot image from the <a href="">Glass developer page</a>.</p>
<pre><code>fastboot flash boot boot.img
fastboot reboot
adb root
adb shell
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to update to a new OTA (in my case XE12) and
rooted your device,
you can download the zip with all necessary images from
Google. It&rsquo;s cool that they support rooting and
flashing (even if it voids your warranty).</p>
<pre><code>fastboot flash boot boot.img
fastboot flash system system.img
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
fastboot flash userdata userdata.img
fastboot erase cache
</code></pre>
<p>##Reading out the Proximity Sensor##
I&rsquo;m most interested in accessing the proximity
sensor facing the eye. So thanks to Philip Scholl&rsquo;s and
Shoya&rsquo;s help, I was able to do it.
The device is under</p>
<pre><code>adb root
adb shell
&gt; cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/4-0035/proxraw
</code></pre>
<p>Gives back one raw proximity value from
the sensor. Unfortunately without timestamp.
If you want to read out the proximity
data from Android Apps etc. you need to change
the access rights.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;chmod 664 /sys/bus/i2c/devices/4-0035/proxraw
</code></pre>
<p>##Privacy Enhancement##</p>
<p>As I will be visiting the <a href="">Chaos Communication Congress</a>
next weekend, I wanted to &ldquo;privacy enhance&rdquo; GLASS
for the event. I want to wear Glass but don&rsquo;t
really need the camera functionality.</p>
<p>So I used my <a href="http://www.the3doodler.com">3Doodler</a> to make a simple attachment to block the camera of.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/doodler.jpg" alt="Doodler"></p>
<p>The tricky part is that the light sensor for adjusting
screen brightness is directly under the camera.
If it&rsquo;s blocked the screen will be very dark.
Here&rsquo;s the &ldquo;privacy enhanced&rdquo; Google Glass version.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/glass_p.jpg" alt="Glass Enhanced"></p>
<p>and a picture taken by it. It&rsquo;s not completely black
due to the issue with the light sensor, yet I
think it&rsquo;s a start ;)</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/glass_p2.jpg" alt="Glass Enhanced"></p>
<p>Here is the very <a href="/imgs/glass.stencil.pdf">basic stencil</a> I used to build the attachment.</p>

        <p class="lead"> An interview made me wonder about how reading habits are changing and how we will narrate stories in the future. </p>
<p>Recently, I gave an interview for the German online issue
of the Scientific American (<a href="http://spectrum.de/">Spectrum der Wissenschaft</a>) for a <a href="http://www.spektrum.de/alias/lesen/bits-und-bytes-statt-buchregal/1211519">special about reading habits (in German, paywall)</a>.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m interested in the topic, I often hear
that &ldquo;endless scrolling&rdquo; is bad as it destroys
the mental map we make of books and pages or
that reading from backlit screens is eye-straining
inducing headaches. Personally, I cannot really
understand these complaints. I&rsquo;m doing most
of my reading on tablet devices or computer screens
though I never experienced these problems directly.</p>
<p>However, active reading -the process of working with the text through highlight, notes, marks- is still better
on paper. In Human Computer interaction terms, people talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordances</a>. The affordance of paper is very high for active reading. So I find myself still printing out drafts
or review papers, especially if it&rsquo;s a close call and
I need to concentrate on the contents. In later case, I even like to change the reading environment, moving away
from my laptop/desktop to a meeting table or a bank outside. I believe this helps me concentrate, deliberately shutting out any distractions.</p>
<p>We just started to modify the reading experience using electronic devices.
So far most of the applications and reading devices
directly mimic the book. We have &ldquo;ebooks&rdquo;, &ldquo;e-reading&rdquo; software
use pages and page turns etc. I believe there is a lot of room for improvement related to reading on screens.</p>
<p>Given the possibility to assess the user&rsquo;s mental state using
<a href="/papers/kunze2013activity.pdf">Cognitive Activity Recognition</a>, we
can change content, structure and style of reading materials dynamically.
Most straight forward, if an application detects that a reader looses
interest, it could prompt her with an interactive challenge/video or
similar. Changing fonts, colors and lettering according to mood and
context could be also interesting. There is a fairly new
playground opening up for anybody curious and interested in
defining new forms of reading.</p>
