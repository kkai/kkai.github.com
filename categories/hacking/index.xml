      <description>Over the last couple of weeks, I was getting settled in my new job. As I&amp;rsquo;m working with computer vision researchers now, I started playing with the camera api for the iPhone.
Again, I&amp;rsquo;m very surprised by the accessibility and quality of Apples apis and their sample code.
As a start, this little app is a &amp;ldquo;privacy enhanced&amp;rdquo; camera app for entertainment purposes. It uses face detection and draws a little laughing face on top of each recognized head in real time.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I built a simple demonstration on how to stream accelerometer data from a mobile device over websockets to a server just using html and javascript. It consists of a nodejs web server and a processing.org visualization. As soon as a mobile browser connects to the server a new red cube is shown on the screen (placed between randomly generated cubes). The transparent area around the cube changes depending on how strong one shakes the phone.</description>
