                    <h2 class="section-heading">Toward the Knowledge Log</h2>
                    <p class="primary">Lifelogging technologies, the use of sensing technologies to analyze and record one’s lives, is on the rise. Products from industry and research in academia currently focus on using the collected data to support health and fitness. Given these trends, it is only a matter of time before we see mobile sens- ing technology applied to cognitive tasks, enabling novel research directions and use cases. In this workshop, we explore the implications of ”knowledge logging”, how to record and track what we read, learn, comprehend and how this impacts research towards mind augmentation. The goal of this workshop is to combine innovations in ubiquitous computing with basic research in psychology and cognitive science. The aim is to bring mind augmentation technologies from a niche application in rehabilitation to a mainstream technology and initiating a major change in the way we use technology to externalize our mind. This workshop will bring together researchers, designers and practitioners at the intersection of technology and cognitive psychology to discuss elements and viewpoints of knowledge logging, inferring cognitive states and extending our perception.<p>

                    Although body perception is commonly felt in our daily lives, it is the least understood and appreciated modality in five senses. Since the body perception is rather implicit, we do not consider this is vulnerable and enhanceable. However, recent behavioral neuroscience findings report multiple phenomena that have tight relationship between body and brain activity that leads to our decision making, which are called embodied cognition. In this talk I introduce several interesting topics in body and mind study and possible research direction in embodied media. Hands-on exercise session will be included.

                    Speaker: <a href="http://www.merkel.jp/">Prof. Dr. Masashi Nakatani</a>

                    Dr. Nakatani works as Project Associate Professor at the Graduate School of Media Design, Keio University, Project Research Scientist at the Institute of Gerontology, University of Tokyo. His expertise and research themes include psychology on tactile perception, physiology on skin sensation (in vitro), haptic and tactile sensors development and haptic design for everyone.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Augmenting Human Mind by Gaze-Based Technologies</h2>
In the age of digitalization we are confronted with an overwhelming data and process complexity. As a consequence the cognitive load of knowledge workers is continuously increasing and we are lacking in extensions, which augment our intellect helping us to understand, increase our understanding, enhance our problem solving capacity, or complement our skills. This is not a new phenomenon but recent advances in eye tracking technologies allow to use the eyes both as a source for understanding cognitive states but also as a means for interacting with objects and subjects in the real world. Such new options are of increasing interest for developing „electronic information butlers and amplifiers“ that are able to anticipate what may be required in a given context and offer us all relevant information. In this talk I like to address the various aspects of augmenting human mind by gaze-based technologies. I will propose and discuss a bunch of approaches and technologies aiming at a more-rapid and better comprehension of human activities as well as their support by learning from gaze behavior. I will demonstrate experimental results from the office field, from medicine as well as from physics education, and further show some applications in the area of infotainment.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Call for Participation</h2>
                    <p>To approach the challenges of augmenting the human mind, we will focus on the following themes, depending on participants’ contributions:<p>
                        Sensing Technologies: How do signals gathered from ubiquitous sensing devices relate to cognitive processes? Defining sensing and interaction modalities to better understand human behavior.<p>
Applied cognitive theories: How can we use these real life recordings of physical, physiological and cognitive signals to augment our mind and, for example, induce wanted long-term behavior change for users?
<p>
Building ”knowledge logs”: From an information retrieval and processing perspective we want to discuss potential technologies relevant for cognitive processing. Personal “knowledge logs” can be can be compiled from sensing using adaptive algorithms automated daily summaries.<p>

HCI to extend the mind: we are looking for Innovative User Interfaces for mind augmentation, including technologies for information priming. For example, how can feedback through ambient large displays and personal mobile devices aid personal knowledge acquisition, retention, and attenuation?<p>

Commercial application areas for human mind augmentation: While many of the application domains for such technologies are for the public good, the same technologies can also be employed in the commercial context. For example, technology could be used to augment meetings detecting the comprehension of each participant and help mitigate potential misunderstandings.<p>
Discussing privacy security and social implications.<p>

The goals of the WAHM 2015 workshop picks up on last year’s theme: we want to foster discussions about technologies that nurture the augmentation of the human mind. Given the good reception of the first workshop and the feedback that we should include a broader range of topics (last year focused on memory), we are working on extending our community. The above-mentioned themes will be used as a starting point for the discussion and group analysis (described below). However, we will also pay attention to new themes possibly emerging from morning presentation and discussions. In addition to shaping the research agenda, we will also dis- cuss social impact and potential commercial applications. To this end we will also invite representatives from corporate re- search.
