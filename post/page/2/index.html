   <p class="blog-post-meta">Mon, Feb 9, 2015</p>
    Here are the video and slides from my talk. Hope you like it. Please if you have some critique write me a mail.
I got tremendous, positive feedback. Thanks a lot! Even Heise had a news post about it. http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/31C3-Mit-smarten-Brillen-das-Gehirn-ausforschen-2507482.html (Although I cannot and don&rsquo;t want to read your thoughts, as the article implies ;-) ).

    Finally, I have a little time to write about the congress. As the last couple of years, I attended the 31st Chaos Communication Congress between Christmas and New Year. Here&rsquo;s my talk selection in random order (I definitely forgot some as I haven&rsquo;t watched all):
The Machine to be Another great research and talk. Mesmerizing, I&rsquo;m thinking about how to use this effect for my work ;)

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Sun, Nov 30, 2014</p>
    Smart glasses and, in general, eyewear are a fairly novel device class with a lot of possibilities for unobtrusive activity tracking. That's why I'm very excited to be working in the Team of Masahiko Inami Sensei at Keio Media Design to do research on J!NS MEME.
You might have seen the J!NS academic videos  by now, I added embedded versions to the end of the post.
Bellow is the full video of the sneak peek of our work in the J! <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2014/11/30/eyewear-computing/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Sun, Aug 24, 2014</p>
    As the first article about my grandparents using Google Glass received a lot of interest, I decided to delve a little bit more into the topic.
My grandparents conducted a longer Google Glass usability study for me. I&rsquo;m happy they agreed that I can use their images and insights to share here.
##Evaluation of the Current Google Glass
My grandparents mentioned that the current functionality of the device is quite limited. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2014/08/24/google-glass-for-eldery/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</p>
    With roughly around 1 month to go, we are busy with demo preparations etc. I hope to see you in Seattle. This year we have again a couple papers outline work from our students. Attached is a list with draft versions of the papers. I will write a bit about each topic in the next coming weeks.
Oh and if you attend please think about stopping by our Workshop on Ubiquitous Technologies for Augmenting the Human Mind. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2014/08/10/looking-forward-to-iswcubicomp-2014/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Wed, Mar 19, 2014</p>
    Innovative research, that makes you first laugh and then think. The conference develops into one of my favorite venues.
Ok, I&rsquo;m &ldquo;a bit&rdquo; biased as I&rsquo;m one of the conference co-chairs. Still I enjoyed this years Augmented Human. Below is the tag cloud from all abstracts, to give you a brief overview about the topics.
Considering the small size of the conference, the quality of the work is exceptional. It&rsquo;s not one of the conferences that gets the rejected papers from CHI, Ubicomp, PerComp etc. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2014/03/19/augmented-human-2014/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Wed, Mar 5, 2014</p>
    Attending the International Symposium on Service Systems Science on the 26.02.2014 in Tokyo, I got a glimpse on how the next steps of FuturICT and how similar projects and efforts are on their way in Japan. Although the FuturICT project did not get funding from the EU so far (I still believe this was a grave mistake), I can see that the spirit and our ideas live on. The Japanese COI-T Program focuses on the same issues and problems as FuturICT. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2014/03/05/attending-the-symposium-on-service-systems-science/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Thu, Feb 13, 2014</p>
    Introducing Google Glass to Hacker News Kansai Community was a lot of fun. I&rsquo;m sorry it took so long to put online. Too much to do, especially due to Augmented Human 2014 (really looking forward to the beginning of march) :)
As part of our monthly Hacker News meetupin Kansai, I gave a small introduction on how to use (and hack for) Google Glass. 
The slides are also available as pdf download (7 MB). <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2014/02/13/glass-talk-at-hacker-news-kansai/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Tue, Jan 28, 2014</p>
    Impressions and Talk Recommendations. Finally, a couple of days with normal people ...
Honestly I was impressed by the professionalism of the 30th Chaos Communication Congress. It changed a lot from the last time I visited ( 25c3), grew bigger without loosing its atmosphere. With the assemblies and workshops the event starts to get more and more interactive.
##Talk Recommendations##
I link to the youtube streams of the recordings yet you can get them also over at media. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2014/01/28/looking-back-at-30c3/"> Read more... </a>

    Discussing activity recognition for the Mind and its potential applications. Here are my talk slides for my 30c3 talk &hellip; Sorry it took so long. Thanks for the great feedback, will write a bit more if I have sometime ;)
The video is also online. This happened very quick after the event. I&rsquo;m impressed by the 30c3 content team.
  Thanks a lot for the great reviews and suggestions. They are highly appreciated. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2013/12/28/30c3-toward-a-cognitive-quantified-self/"> Read more... </a>
