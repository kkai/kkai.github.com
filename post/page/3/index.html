   <p class="blog-post-meta">Sun, Dec 22, 2013</p>
    So I got my hands on another Glass device and can now play with it a bit longer. Disclaimer: Rooting and flashing your device voids your warranty and can brick your Glass. Also you won&rsquo;t receive OTA updates afterwards. This is not an instruction manual. I just use it as a scratch pad to give a record what I did and what worked for me. The commands below will erase all data on your device. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2013/12/22/hacking-glass/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Fri, Nov 29, 2013</p>
    An interview made me wonder about how reading habits are changing and how we will narrate stories in the future. Recently, I gave an interview for the German online issue of the Scientific American (Spectrum der Wissenschaft) for a special about reading habits (in German, paywall).
As I&rsquo;m interested in the topic, I often hear that &ldquo;endless scrolling&rdquo; is bad as it destroys the mental map we make of books and pages or that reading from backlit screens is eye-straining inducing headaches. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2013/11/29/bits-and-bytes-instead-of-a-book-shelf/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Tue, Nov 5, 2013</p>
    Cool research discussions at a nice location. The workshop was perfect fit to my research interests.
The ASVAI workshop gave a good overview about several research efforts part of and related to the JST CREST and the JSPS Core-to-Core Sanken Program.
Prof. Yasushi Yagi showed how to infer intention from gait analysis. Interestingly, he showed research about the relationship of gaze and gait.
Dr. Alireza Fathi presented cool work about ego centric cameras. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2013/11/05/amazing-okinawa-attending-the-asvai-workshop/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Fri, Sep 20, 2013</p>
    How my grandparents interact with GLASS, showed me that Google seems to be onto something. As there were a lot of researchers visiting for the Ubicomp /ISWC conferences, I could grab a Google Glass from one of the participants for a week. Thanks to the anonymous donor (to avoid speculations it was none of the people mentioned below). In the following some unsorted thoughts &hellip; Sorry for typos etc. It&rsquo;s more a scratch pad so I don&rsquo;t forget the impressions I had. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2013/09/20/a-week-with-glass/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Sun, Sep 15, 2013</p>
    Usually, I&rsquo;m not such a big fan of conference openings, yet Friedemann Mattern provided a great intro giving an overview about the origins of Pervasive and Ubicom mentioning all important people and showing nice vintage pictures from Hans Gellersen, Alois Ferscha, Marc Langheinrich, Albrecht Schmidt, Kristof Van Laerhoven etc.
Deeply impressed by the organization, social and general talk quality, I was a bit sceptical before the merger of Pervasive / Ubicom and collocating ISWC, yet it was completely unfounded. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2013/09/15/ubicom-iswc-impressions/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Fri, Sep 6, 2013</p>
    This year I&rsquo;m really looking forward to Ubicomp and ISWC, it&rsquo;s the first time that Ubicomp and Pervasive merged into one conference and it&rsquo;s the first time the venue sold out with 700 participants.
I cannot wait to chat with old friends and experts (most are both :)).
The field slowly matures. Especially, the wearable research is really pushing towards prime-time. Most prominently, Google Glass is getting a lot of focus also discussing its impacts on privacy. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2013/09/06/excited-about-ubicomp-and-iswc/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Mon, Aug 26, 2013</p>
    The slides for my two talks today are online now.
##The Wordometer##
 ##Reading activity recognition using an off-the-shelf EEG##
 For more details, check out the papers: * The Wordometer – Estimating the Number of Words Read Using Document Image Retrieval and Mobile Eye Tracking * Reading Activity Recognition using an off-the-shelf EEG — Detecting Reading Activities and Distinguishing Genres of Documents
They are both published at ICDAR 2013. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2013/08/26/icdar-2013-talk-slides-online/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Fri, Aug 23, 2013</p>
    Just finished my keynote talk at CBDAR (Workshop of ICDAR), got a lot of questions and have a lot of new research ideas :)
I&rsquo;m pretty ignorant about Document Analysis (and Computer Vision in general), so it&rsquo;s great to talk to some experts in the field. Pervasive Computing and Document Analysis are very complementary and as such interesting to combine.
Here are my talk slides, followed by the talk abstract. <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2013/08/23/recognizing-reading-activities/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Tue, Aug 20, 2013</p>
    In the last couple of months, I got more and more interested in learning, especially reading. Loving tech and sports, I got easily hooked on the Quantified Self movement (I own a Zeo Sleeping Coach and several step counters). Seeing how measuring myself transformed me. I lost around 4 kg and feel healthier/fitter, since I started tracking. I wonder why we don&rsquo;t have similar tools for our learning behavior.
So we created a simple Wordometer in our Lab, using the SMI mobile eyetracker and document image retrieval (LLAH). <a href="http://kaikunze.de/2013/08/20/wordometer-and-document-analysis-using-pervasive-sensing/"> Read more... </a>

   <p class="blog-post-meta">Mon, Apr 29, 2013</p>
    So it&rsquo;s my first time at CHI. Pretty amazing so far &hellip; Will blog about more later.
I&rsquo;m in the first poster rotation, starting this afternoon: &ldquo;Towards inferring language expertise using eye tracking&rdquo; Drop by my poster if you&rsquo;re around (or try to spot me, I&rsquo;m wearing the white &ldquo;Kai@CHI&rdquo; Shirt today :)).
Here&rsquo;s the abstract of our work, as well as the link to the paper.
