 <p class="blog-post-meta">Sun, Aug 20, 2017</p>
  <p>On the 9th August I had the opportunity to take part in a Miraikan Science Quest.
It&rsquo;s an open event at Miraikan, the Science Museum in Tokyo, to encourage
a dialog between the public and researchers. This Science Quest was a premier,
as it was the first ever held in English ;)</p>

<p>The talk gives an overview about the emerging field of smart glasses and how they can be used to detect cognitive states (what is going on in your mind). I present first application scenarios about tracking reading activities towards attention management. In an increasingly interconnected world, and with a greater flow of information, more people are having problems with keeping attention and focus. We discuss also how smart glasses can help with attention and stress management.

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m very happy. We had over 140 guests in total for the two events
and I could gather quite interesting feedback for my research direction,
especially in terms of application areas and use cases.</p>
