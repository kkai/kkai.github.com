      <description>So I got my hands on another Glass device and can now play with it a bit longer. Disclaimer: Rooting and flashing your device voids your warranty and can brick your Glass. Also you won&amp;rsquo;t receive OTA updates afterwards. This is not an instruction manual. I just use it as a scratch pad to give a record what I did and what worked for me. The commands below will erase all data on your device.</description>

      <description>How my grandparents interact with GLASS, showed me that Google seems to be onto something. As there were a lot of researchers visiting for the Ubicomp /ISWC conferences, I could grab a Google Glass from one of the participants for a week. Thanks to the anonymous donor (to avoid speculations it was none of the people mentioned below). In the following some unsorted thoughts &amp;hellip; Sorry for typos etc. It&amp;rsquo;s more a scratch pad so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget the impressions I had.</description>
