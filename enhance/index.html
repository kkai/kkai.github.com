  <h2 class="blog-post-title"> Human Enhancement</h2>
  

<p>My research is motivated by sensory
technology that can track most aspects of
our lives and is in many ways better than
human senses. This technology can
enhance our senses. I want to create systems
that allow us to experience the world in a
novel enhanced way and boost how we
perceive our environment. I want to
design enhanced synthetic senses that are
easy to use. I believe that extending and
augmenting human perception will
revolutionize the field of human computer interaction.
My research is motivated by sensory technology that can track most aspects of our lives and is in many ways better or complimentary to human senses. I want to work on systems that extend human sensory capabilities in an intuitive way using digital technology. Such extension would be continuously available and transparent in use. A lot of digital sensor technology is already complimentary to human senses and we employ them already in tools (e.g. heat cameras, radiation sensors, x-ray). However, their use is by far not straightforward or intuitive. Affordances of using these tools seamlessly in everyday life are still too high. How can we create human machine interfaces for this sensing technologies to enhance our senses?
My future work focuses on how to create new representations of digital sensor information to make it easier for a human to understand their relevancy and in a second step also using these insights to create novel, artificial senses.</p>
