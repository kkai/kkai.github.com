  <h2 class="blog-post-title"> Smart Eyewear</h2>
  

<p>Smart Eyewear is the major enabling technology to enable applications
that change long term behavior and enhance human senses.
Most of our senses, vital signs, and actions involve the head,
marking the human skull one of the most interesting body locations for
simultaneous sensing and interactions of assistance applications.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/eyewear-overview.jpg" alt="overview" /></p>

<p>While hearing aids and mobile headsets got widely accepted as head-worn devices,
users in public spaces often consider novel head-attached sensors and devices as
uncomfortable, irritating, or stigmatizing. Yet, we can integrate commonly needed
sensing and interaction modalities in he form factor of traditional eyeglasses,
yielding multi-purpose wearable monitoring and assistance devices.
There are patterns in our physiological signals and behavior (facial expressions,
nose temperature, eye movements, blinks etc.) that can tell us about our
mental condition and cognitive functions. I want to explore how to use these
patterns to recognize mental states and in a second step searches for interactions
to change our mental states by stimulating us to change these patterns. &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo;,
currently hyped, has a big flaw: correlation does not equal causation and adding a
lot of data will not only provide more insights but also a lot of unrelated correlations.
Given Smart Eye Wear and other novel sensing devices, we can finally explore the decisions
our embodied minds do on a large scale in real life. We can find the hidden patterns that
make up our decision processes. First exploring cognitive activities related to behavior of
the individual and then aggregating over small communities, cities and countries. We are able
to build up pervasive “behavior maps” based on causation not correlation, exploring what makes up
the social fabric.</p>
