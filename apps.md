##![snsrlog](./imgs/snsrlog.png) snsrlog 
An app to record, stream and label sensor data
from the iPhone. It's geared towards developers and
researchers.

The app is written by Benjamin Thiel and
started as a software project under my supervision building
on previous tools we coded at the Embedded
Systems Lab in Passau (yet, so far I did not contribute
a single line of code to this new version ;)
