  <p>This is a scratchpad &hellip; will fill the rest when I have time.</p>

<p>##Papers
I really enjoyed the work from Heng Liu, Tao Mei et. al.
&ldquo;Finding Perfect Rendezvous On the Go: Accurate Mobile Visual Localization and Its Applications to Routing&rdquo;.
They combine existing research in a very interesting mixture. They use a visual localization method
based on <a href="http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/">bundler</a> to detect where in the city
a mobile phone user is. The application scenario I liked best was their collaborative localization
for rendezvous :)</p>

<p>The best paper award went to Zhi Wang, Lifeng Sun, Xiangwen Chen, Wenwu Zhu, Jiangchuan Liu, Minghua Chen and Shiqiang Yang for &ldquo;Propagation-Based Social-Aware Replication for Social Video Contents&rdquo;. They use the contacts mined over
social networking to replicate content for better streaming and content distribution.
The presentation was great, the research solid, still it&rsquo;s not a topic I&rsquo;m very interested in. However, for content providers it seems very useful.</p>

<p>Shih-Yao Lin et. al. presented a system to recognize the users motion using the kinect and imitate them via a
marionette in &ldquo;Action Recognition for Human-Marionette Interaction&rdquo;. I hoped to get more information
about the interactions between users and marionettes, still very stylish presentation and artsy topic.</p>

<p>Hamdi Dibeklioglu et. al. showed how to infer the age of a person when they are simling in &ldquo;A Smile Can Reveal Your Age: Enabling Facial Dynamics in Age Estimation&rdquo;. I find fascinating to hear about small cues that can
tell a lot about a person or a situation.</p>

<p>Fascinating work by Victoria Yanulevskaya et. al. (&ldquo;In the Eye of the Beholder: Employing Statistical Analysis and Eye Tracking for Analyzing Abstract Paintings&rdquo;). They link the emotional impact of a painting to the eye movements
of the observer. Very interesting and in line with my current focus. I wonder if also expertise etc. can be
recognized using sensors.</p>

<p>Another very art focused paper I enjoyed was &ldquo;Dinner of LucieÃÅrnaga-An interactive Play with iPhone App in Theater&rdquo;
by Yu-Chuan Tseng. Theater visitors can interact with the play using their smart phone (getting also feedback on the device &hellip;.).</p>

<p>##Posters, Demos, Competitions</p>

<p>The winner of the Multimedia Grand Challenge was very well deserved. &ldquo;Analysis of Dance Movements using Gaussian Processes&rdquo; by Antoine Liutkus et. al. decomposed dance moves using Gaussian processes in movements with
slow periodicity, high periodicity and moves that happened just once. Fascinating and applicable to so many fields &hellip; :)</p>

<p>A very neat demo was presented by Wei Zhang et. al.: &ldquo;FashionAsk: Pushing Community Answers to Your Fingertips&rdquo;.</p>

<p>##Other Notes
As expected from any conference in Japan :), the organisation was flawless.
In case any if the organisers is reading this. Thanks again. Nara is a perfect place for a venue like this
(deer, world heritage sites, good food &hellip;).</p>

<p>More curiously, although there was a lot of talk about social media and some lively discussions
on twitter, I seemed to be the only participant on <a href="https://alpha.app.net/">ADN</a> at least posting with hashtag.</p>
