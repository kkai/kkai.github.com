 <p class="blog-post-meta">Thu, Aug 30, 2012</p>
  <p>Over the last couple of weeks, I was getting settled in my new job.
As I&rsquo;m working with <a href="http://imlab.jp">computer vision researchers</a> now,
I started playing with the camera api for the iPhone.</p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;m very surprised by the accessibility and quality of Apples
apis and their sample code.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/laughing.png" alt="Laughing Face" /></p>

<p>As a start, this little app is a &ldquo;privacy enhanced&rdquo; camera
app for entertainment purposes.
It uses face detection and draws a little
laughing face on top of each recognized head in real time.
I hesitated putting it in the store, yet was asked by some friends to
do so (had to exchange the laughing face due to copyright constraints).</p>

<p>Grab it while it&rsquo;s hot &hellip; it&rsquo;s quite popular in Japan (understandable
given the background, see below), China and Saudi Arabia (of all places, &hellip; if
somebody can tell me why, please send me a mail):
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/laughing-faces/id551656355?mt=8">Laughing Faces AppStore Link</a></p>

<p>By the way, I had over 250 downloads the first day :)
Oh if you wonder, the inspiration came from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_Man_(Ghost_in_the_Shell)">Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex</a></p>

<p>If people bug me enough, I will make the png exchangable.
Cannot tell you too much, yet expect an update when iOS6 hits.</p>
