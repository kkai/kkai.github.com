 <p class="blog-post-meta">Wed, Feb 18, 2015</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m getting more and more fascinated by augmenting Blind Soccer.
After 3 blind soccer trainings, we had now a couple
of meetings to discuss how to extend and enhance the play experience.</p>

<p>For me there are 3 interesting points about blind
soccer:</p>

<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s very hard to learn. Can we make it easier for blind people to learn it?
If you can play it, it&rsquo;s very fast and empowering. We train with a soccer player from the Japanese national team.  He plays better than me without being blind folded (ok &hellip; that&rsquo;s maybe not really an achievement, I&rsquo;m terrible at soccer).</li>
<li>Can we make it easier for seeing people learn blind soccer and in turn understand more about the blind and improve their hearing skills?</li>
<li>Can we level the playing field making it possible for blind and seeing to play together using tech?</li>
</ol>

<p>However, the most interesting point, I think blind soccer can teach us that &ldquo;disability&rdquo; is a question of definition and the environment.</p>

<p>If you can play it, it&rsquo;s very fast and empowering. We train with a soccer player from the Japanese national team.  He plays better than me without being blind folded (ok &hellip; that&rsquo;s maybe not really an achievement, I&rsquo;m terrible at soccer).</p>

<p>The biggest take-away for me, I rely too much on vision to make sense of my environment. The training made me more aware of sounds. I find myself to listen more and more. Sometimes in a train on the street etc., I now close my eyes and explore the environment just by sound. It&rsquo;s fascinating how much we can hear. This opened a new world for me. Looking into it more, I believe sound is an underestimated modality for augmented and virtual realities, which is worth exploring more.
I stumbled over a couple of papers about sonic interface design. Looking forward to applying some of the findings we get out of the blind soccer use case to our lives ;)</p>

<p>If I have some more time, I&rsquo;ll write a bit more about the training and the ideathlons we did so far. In the mean time, I recommend you try it sometime (if you are near Tokyo, you can maybe also join our sessions).</p>
