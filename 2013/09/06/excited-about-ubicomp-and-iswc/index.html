 <p class="blog-post-meta">Fri, Sep 6, 2013</p>
  <p>This year I&rsquo;m really looking forward to <a href="http://ubicomp.org">Ubicomp</a> and <a href="http://iswc.net">ISWC</a>,
it&rsquo;s the first time that Ubicomp and Pervasive merged into one conference and it&rsquo;s the first time the venue sold out with 700 participants.</p>

<p>I cannot wait to chat with old friends and experts (most are both :)).</p>

<p>The field slowly matures. Especially, the wearable research is really pushing towards prime-time. Most prominently, Google Glass is getting a lot of focus also discussing its impacts on privacy. Yet, there is more and more talk about fitness bracelets/trackers and smart watches. I expect that we see more intelligent clothes and activity recognition work in commercial products in the coming years.</p>

<p>By the way, we have 3 poster papers and 2 demos at Ubicomp
and a short paper at ISWC.</p>

<p>###Ubicomp Demos and Posters###</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/papers/kunze2013my.pdf">My Reading Life – Towards Utilizing Eyetracking on Unmodified Tablets and Phones</a></li>
<li><a href="/papers/kunze2013annotate.pdf">Annotate Me – Supporting Active Reading using Real-Time Document Image Retrieval On Mobile Devices</a></li>
<li><a href="/papers/cheng2013activity.pdf">Activity Recognition and Nutrition Monitoring in Every Day Situations with a Textile Capacitive Neckband</a></li>
</ul>

<p>###ISWC paper###
* <a href="/papers/kunze2013know.pdf">I know what you are reading – Recognition of Document Types Using Mobile Eye Tracking</a></p>

<p>Drop by at the demo,poster sessions and/or see me my talk on Thursday.</p>

<p>On a side note, Ubicomp really picks great locations. This year it&rsquo;s Zurich, next year Seattle and the year after it will be in Osaka. Seems I might be staying longer in Japan, than I originally planned ;)</p>
