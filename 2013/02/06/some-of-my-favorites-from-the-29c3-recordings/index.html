 <p class="blog-post-meta">Wed, Feb 6, 2013</p>
  <p>Over the last weeks, I finally got around to watch some of the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/wiki/Main_Page">29c3</a> recordings. Here are some of my favorites. I will update the list accordingly.</p>

<p>I link to the official recording available from the CCC domain. The talks however are also on youtube. Just search for the talk title.</p>

<p>In General, I found most talks focused on security, sadly not really my main interest. I missed some research and culture talks that were present the last years. Examples from the last years:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS4k0hFhPeQ">Data Mining for Hackers</a> awesome talk!! or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxf60pRz1tM">one</a> of Bicyclemark episodes. Bicylcemark we miss you :)</p>

<p>##English</p>

<p>Out of the hacking talks, for me by far the most entertaining was <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2012/29c3-5400-en-hacking_cisco_phones_h264.html">Hacking Cisco Phones</a>. Scary and so cool. Ang Cui and Michael Costello are also quite good presenters. The hand-drawn slides give the visuals also a nice touch. I won&rsquo;t spoil the contents. just watch it.</p>

<p>So far my most favorite talk is <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2012/29c3-5138-en-romantichackers_h264.html">Romantic Hackers</a> by Anne Marggraf-Turley and Prof. Richard Marggraf-Turley. About surveillance andy hackers in the Romantic period. I was not aware that the privacy problems and the ideas about pervasive surveillance had been discussed and encountered so early in human history. Very Insightful and fun.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2012/29c3-5088-en-many_tamagotchis_were_harmed_in_the_making_of_this_presentation_h264.html">Tamagochi Talk</a> was fun. Although the speaker seemed to be a bit nervous (listening to her voice), she gave some great insides how Tamagochis work and how to hack them.</p>

<p>The keynote from Jacob Applebaum, <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2012/29c3-5385-en-not_my_department_h264.html">Not my department</a> is a call to action for the tech community discussing about the responsibilities we have regarding our research and how it might be used. Although Applebaum is a great public speaker and the topic is of utmost importance, for some people new to the discussion it might seem a bit out of context and difficult to understand.</p>

<p>##German</p>

<p>If you can speak German or want to practice it, check them out &hellip;
Of course, the usual subjects <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2012/29c3-5198-en-de-fnord_jahresrueckblick2012_h264.html">Fnord News Show</a> and <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2012/29c3-5244-de-en-security_nightmares2012_h264.html">Security Nightmares</a> are always great candidates to watch.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also always looking forward to the yearly Martin Haase Talk. Unfortunately, the official release is not online yet. Interesting especially for language geeks.</p>

<p>The talk <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2012/29c3-5121-de-en-sind_faire_computer_moeglich_h264.html">Are fair computers possible?</a> explores what needs to change in manufacturing standards etc. to produce computers without child labor and fair employment conditions for all workers involved.</p>
