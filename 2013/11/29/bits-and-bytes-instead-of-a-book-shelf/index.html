  <p class="lead"> An interview made me wonder about how reading habits are changing and how we will narrate stories in the future. </p>

<p>Recently, I gave an interview for the German online issue
of the Scientific American (<a href="http://spectrum.de/">Spectrum der Wissenschaft</a>) for a <a href="http://www.spektrum.de/alias/lesen/bits-und-bytes-statt-buchregal/1211519">special about reading habits (in German, paywall)</a>.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m interested in the topic, I often hear
that &ldquo;endless scrolling&rdquo; is bad as it destroys
the mental map we make of books and pages or
that reading from backlit screens is eye-straining
inducing headaches. Personally, I cannot really
understand these complaints. I&rsquo;m doing most
of my reading on tablet devices or computer screens
though I never experienced these problems directly.</p>

<p>However, active reading -the process of working with the text through highlight, notes, marks- is still better
on paper. In Human Computer interaction terms, people talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordances</a>. The affordance of paper is very high for active reading. So I find myself still printing out drafts
or review papers, especially if it&rsquo;s a close call and
I need to concentrate on the contents. In later case, I even like to change the reading environment, moving away
from my laptop/desktop to a meeting table or a bank outside. I believe this helps me concentrate, deliberately shutting out any distractions.</p>

<p>We just started to modify the reading experience using electronic devices.
So far most of the applications and reading devices
directly mimic the book. We have &ldquo;ebooks&rdquo;, &ldquo;e-reading&rdquo; software
use pages and page turns etc. I believe there is a lot of room for improvement related to reading on screens.</p>

<p>Given the possibility to assess the user&rsquo;s mental state using
<a href="/papers/kunze2013activity.pdf">Cognitive Activity Recognition</a>, we
can change content, structure and style of reading materials dynamically.
Most straight forward, if an application detects that a reader looses
interest, it could prompt her with an interactive challenge/video or
similar. Changing fonts, colors and lettering according to mood and
context could be also interesting. There is a fairly new
playground opening up for anybody curious and interested in
defining new forms of reading.</p>
