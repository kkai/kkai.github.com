  <p>My second Siggraph was pretty amazing again. Unfortunately, we had another
emerging technology exhibit, so my time joining the main conference was limited.
</p>

<p>We presented atmoSphere and had great feedback.</p>

<p>A short description from the abstract:</p>

<p>We use cross-modal correspondence -the interaction between two or more sensory modalities- to create an engaging user experience. We present atmoSphere, a system that provides users immersive music experiences using spatial audio and haptic feedback. We focused on cross-modality of auditory and haptic sensations to augment the sound environment.  e atmoSphere consists of a spatialized music and a sphere shaped device which provides haptic feedback. It provides users imagination of large sound environment although they feel haptic sensation in their hands. First user feed- back is very encouraging. According to participants, atmoSphere creates an engaging experience.</p>

<p>From KMD, there were an additional 3 Emerging Technologies exhibits.
Metalimbs won well-earned the best demonstration award.</p>
