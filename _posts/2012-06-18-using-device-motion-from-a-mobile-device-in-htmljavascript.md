A while ago, I built a simple demonstration on how to stream accelerometer 
data from a mobile device over websockets to a server just using
html and javascript. It consists of a nodejs web server and a processing.org
visualization. As soon as a mobile browser connects to the server a new red
cube is shown on the screen (placed between randomly generated cubes). 
The transparent area around the cube changes depending on how strong
one shakes the phone.

You can get the code from my [github page](https://github.com/kkai/devicemotion-demo)

It's based on these tutorials and sample code:
