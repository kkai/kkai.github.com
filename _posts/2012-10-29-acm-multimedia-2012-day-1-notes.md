I attended the Tutorials "Interacting with Image Collections – Visualisation and Browsing of Image Repositories"
and "Continuous Analysis of Emotions for Multimedia Applications"

### Interacting with Image Collections – Visualisation and Browsing of Image Repositories
Schaefer gave a overview about how to browse large scale image repositories. 
Interesting, yet of not really related to my research interests. 
He showed 3 approaches for retrieval: mapping-based, clustering-based and graph-based.
I would have loved if he could have gone a bit more in detail in the mobile section at the end.

### Continuous Analysis of Emotions for Multimedia Applications
Hatice Gunes and Bjoern Schuller introduced a state of the art in emotion analysis.
Their problems seem very similar to what we have to cope with in activity recognition,
especially in terms of segmentation and continuous recognition problems.
