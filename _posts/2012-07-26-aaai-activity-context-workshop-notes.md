I enjoyed the AAAI context activity workshop a lot.

The keynote [How to make Face 
Recognition work (pdf)](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW12/paper/view/5292/5556) 
by [Ashis Kapoor](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/akapoor/)
showed how to increase face recognition introducing very simple "context" constrains
(two people in the same image cannot be the same person etc.).
Very interesting work, I wonder how much better you can get introducing 
some more dynamic context recognition to the face recognition task.

[Gail Murphy](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphy/) gave the other keynote 
[Task Context for Knowledge Workers (pdf)](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW12/paper/view/5302/5557).
She introduces context modelling for tasks in GTD scenarios.
Also quite interesting, as completely complimentary to my work (no mobile
clients, sensors etc.).

A lot of people were aware of our efforts during the
[Opportunity Project](http://www.opportunity-project.eu/) and the standard datasets we want to put out.

Rim Helaoui presented work about using [Probabilistic Description Logics (pdf)](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW12/paper/view/5269/5552)
for activity recognition, an interesting approach trying to combine
  data driven and rule-based activity inference. They used 
  the opportunity dataset ;)

Bostjan Kaluza shared the call for more standardized datasets in context recognition
in his talk about [The Activity Recognition Repository (pdf)](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW12/paper/view/5305/5555).
A very important endeavor, I already also discussed several times.
I think a broad effort in the field is necessary.

All the final papers are up on the [workshop website](http://activitycontext.org/final-papers/).
