Finished my phD. last year in Passau. The
thesis is already published over Opus Bayern.
However only the pdf not the sources.

Finally got around to push the [latex sources
of my dissertation](http://github.com/kkai/phdthesis) up to github.

***

Please feel free to use it as a thesis template,
attribution would be apprecitated ;)

***

Please share if you make improvements, there 
are a lot of hacks and quick fixes in the sources.
