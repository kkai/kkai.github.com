Finished my phD. last year in Passau. The
thesis is already published over [Opus Bayern](http://www.opus-bayern.de/uni-passau/volltexte/2012/2611/).
The pdf is open access, so feel free to read it (careful 19 MB pdf):
[Compensating for On-Body Placement Effects in Activity Recognition as pdf](http://www.opus-bayern.de/uni-passau/volltexte/2012/2611/pdf/kunze_kai.pdf)

However, the sources were not available.
Finally, I got around to push the [latex sources
of my dissertation](http://github.com/kkai/phdthesis) up to github.

***
Please feel free to use it as a thesis template,
attribution would be apprecitated ;)

***
Please share if you make improvements, there 
are a lot of hacks and quick fixes in the sources.

***
I'll try to share most of the algorithms discussed in my dissertation.

Here's a quick summary about the content:

This thesis investigates, how placement variations of electronic 
devices influence the possibility of using sensors integrated in 
those devices for context recognition. The vast majority of context 
recognition research assumes well defined, fixed sen- sor locations. 
Although this might be acceptable for some application domains 
(e.g. in an industrial setting), users, in general, will have a 
hard time coping with these limitations. If one needs to remember 
to carry dedicated sensors and to adjust their orientation from 
time to time, the activity recognition system is more distracting 
than helpful. How can we deal with device location and orientation 
changes to make context 
sensing mainstream? This thesis presents a systematic 
evaluation of device placement effects in context recognition.
