Here's a [draft version of my publication](http://kgarten.de/papers/2012Kunze.pdf) for the [Activity Context Workshop](http://activitycontext.org/)
in Toronto. Bellow the abstract.

Abstract

General representation, abstraction and exchange def- initions are crucial for dynamically configurable con- text recognition. However, to evaluate potential defini- tions, suitable standard datasets are needed. This paper presents our effort to create and maintain large scale, multimodal standard datasets for context recognition re- search. We ourselves used these datasets in previous research to deal with placement effects and presented low-level sensor abstractions in motion based on-body sensing.
Researchers, conducting novel data collections, can rely on the toolchain and the the low-level sensor abstrac- tions summarized in this paper. Additionally, they can draw from our experiences developing and conducting context recognition experiments.
Our toolchain is already a valuable rapid prototyping tool. Still, we plan to extend it to crowd-based sensing, enabling the general public to gather context data, learn more about their lives and contribute to context recog- nition research.
Applying higher level context reasoning on the gathered context data is a obvious extension to our work.
