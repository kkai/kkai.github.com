Over the last couple of weeks, I was getting settled in my new job.
As I'm working with [computer vision researchers](http://imlab.jp) now,
I started playing with the camera api for the iPhone.

Again, I'm very surprised by the accessibility and quality of Apples
apis and their sample code.

As a start, this little app is a "privacy enhanced" camera 
app for entertainment purposes. 
It uses face detection and draws a little 
laughing face on top of each recognized head in real time.
I hesitated putting it in the store, yet was asked by some friends to
do so (had to exchange the laughing face due to copyright constraints).

Grab it while it's hot ... it's quite popular in Japan (understandable 
given the background, see below), China and Saudi Arabia (of all places, ... if
somebody can tell me why, please send me a mail):

By the way, I had over 250 downloads the first day :)
Oh if you wonder, the inspiration came from 
[Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_Man_(Ghost_in_the_Shell))

If people bug me enough, I will make the png exchangable.
Cannot tell you too much, yet expect an update when iOS6 hits.
